# Cracker-Barrel-Game
A Python project used to solve the cracker barrel peg game.

This is a script that I wrote on my phone while riding on a bus to Louisiana. We had visited a Cracker Barrel and, frustrated that I couldn't solve it, I decided to put my programming skills to good use. This explains the extensive use of short and cryptic variable names as programming on a phone when autocorrect is stuck on is annoying at best.

In order to test a particular setup, go into the `Puzzle.__init__` method and modify the setup it creates.
