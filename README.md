# Cracker-Barrel-Game
A Python project used to solve the cracker barrel peg game.

This is a script that I wrote on my phone while riding on a bus to Louisiana. We had visited a Cracker Barrel and, frustrated that I couldn't solve it, I decided to put my programming skills to good use. Thus, it initially used short and cryptic variable names. I have since updated it to be cleaner and more self-documenting, as well as using dynamic programming optimizations.
